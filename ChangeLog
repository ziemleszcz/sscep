Release 20081211
* Patch from Leo Koutikas: set signerkey correctly in pkcs7.c

Release 20071227
* Patch from Bas ten Berge: OpenSSL-related fix + ability to use cert
  serial number as hex

Release 20040325
* Fixed a bug in mkrequest. Thanks for Scott Moynes pointing it out.

Release 20030417
* Modifications from Fiel Cabral ensure that the URL encoded Base64
  PKCS7 is NUL-terminated.

  certificate usage. Do not exit if such a thing happens, just warn.

  method "getca" is used.


First public release was around Jan 25 2003, I guess that would make it
a release 20030125.
